This repo is powered by the workflow described in [Dotfiles: Best Way to Store in a Bare Git Repository](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles).

Many of the settings in this repo are tailored to my work with [**Spinal Cord Toolbox**](https://github.com/spinalcordtoolbox/spinalcordtoolbox) and the broader medical image processing ecosystem.
